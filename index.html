          <p>
            My name is Palestine and i an the land of prophets, martyrs,
            resistance and steadfastness, and the ongoing conflict between right
            and wrong is at the heart of the Middle East, with which the
            conflict of Israeli occupation has lasted for more than 70 years. I
            am an issue on which all generations have been raised. In this blog,
            we will look at my history and religious standing as a cradle of
            divine religions and the influence of Islamic conquest on my land.

            <h5>The Immigration of the Canalans</h5>
            <p>
              The first important human migration to Palestine began at the
              beginning of the third millennium B.C., namely, that of the
              Canadians, who were known as the places where they came down.
              After a period of time, there were three languages: the Canada,
              the Aramaic, the language of Christ, and the Arabic, and Palestine
              continued to be called the land of Kanaan until 1200 B.When the
              Cretaceous tribes invaded her.
            </p>
            <h5>Ibrahim's immigration is at peace.</h5>
            <p>
              In the third millennium B.C., Abraham emigrated peace from the
              town of Orr in Iraq to Palestine, and there was Isaac's father,
              Jacob, also called Israel, and to him the Israelis belonged to
              him.
            </p>
            <h5>Israelis</h5>
            <p>
              Because of the famine in Palestine, Jacob and his children
              emigrated to Egypt, where his son, Joseph, was based on its safes,
              a story that the Holy Quran, in Surah Joseph, separated. The
              Israelis settled in Egypt and there were many in number, but they
              began to be persecuted under Ramses II. Moses decided to bring
              them out to the land of Kanaan, a story that was mentioned in the
              Holy Koran in many places. The children of Israel stayed in the
              desert for 40 years before they were able to enter Palestine after
              the death of Moses. After the death of Moses, there was peace in
              the reign of the prophet Joshua. David was able to establish a
              kingdom for the children of Israel in Jerusalem after the Israelis
              had triumphed over Goliath.
            </p>
            <h5>Palestine under Greek occupation</h5>
            <p>
              Alexander's greatest victory over the Horse is one of the most
              important events of the fourth century B.C., where he captured
              Syria, Gaza and Jerusalem and annexed it to the Greek Empire in
              332 B.After his death, his empire was divided among his leaders,
              and Palestine was under the control of Commander Antejos, who was
              defeated by the Championship in Gaza in 321 B.Since then, I have
              been under the rule of Antijos III in Syria in 198 B.C Since then,
              Palestine has been living in a state of unrest in many States,
              such as the Maccabees and the Arabs of Al-Anbat, in 90 B.M, and
              she remained a member of their "pure" capital until she was
              occupied by the Romans.
            </p>
            <h5>Palestine under Roman occupation</h5>

            <p>
              During the period of Roman rule, Palestine witnessed the birth of
              Jesus son of Mary, but in 37 the Jews roasted him to the Roman
              Governor and accused him of infidelity and death from the story of
              steel, with all its details in the Islamic and Surveying Colonies.
            </p>
            <h5>Jewish rebellion.</h5>
            <p>
              The Jews have tried to exploit the religious freedom that has been
              granted to them in Jerusalem since their return from the
              Babylonian families in the quest for a State of their own, but the
              Romanian Governor, with the help of the Arab population of the
              country, launched an attack on them in 71, occupied Jerusalem and
              killed a large number of Jews before fleeing to Syria, Egypt and
              other Arab countries. The last attempt to establish a Jewish State
              in Palestine was in 135, when a Jewish rabbi claimed to be
              insubordination, when Roman Governor Hadrian attacked them and
              occupied and destroyed the Jewish area of Jerusalem, and a new
              city was built in that place that was denied to Jews. After that
              incident, the Jews did not attempt to stir up any unrest in
              Palestine until the twentieth century, in the middle of which they
              witnessed the establishment of the State of Israel, more than
              2,000 years after the demise of their State in 586 B.Mm-hmm. At
              the hands of Nassar.
            </p>

            <h5>The Islamic Fatah of Palestine</h5>
            <p>
              Al-Khalifa Abu Bakr al-Sadid sent several armies in 633 to open
              the country of Al-Sham, under the leadership of Amr bin al-Ass,
              and to expand the son of Abu Safian, Shafbil bin Hassana, and Abby
              Obaida bin al-Surrah. He defeated the rum in the valley of the
              vehicle south of the Dead Sea and tracked them to Gaza in 634. Amr
              bin Al-Ass made great victories over the Roma in the battle of
              Ajnadin in 634 and opened a stall, Besan Wald and Jaffa, and when
              Theodoros, the brother of Roman Emperor Hercules, took over the
              command of the Roman army, ordered Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, his leader,
              Khaled bin al-Walid, to go from Iraq to Palestine. Al-Khalifa
              Abubakr al-Sadid died and the caliph was taken over by Omar bin
              al-Tabhar, who ordered the Muslim armies present in Palestine to
              continue fighting to complete Fatah. Khaled bin al-Walid ordered
              the unification of the Islamic armies into one army. Khaled
              clashed with the Roma in the battle of Yarmouk, where the Muslim
              victory was a decisive moment in the history of Palestine, when
              the Romans were expelled from it. He required that Caliph Omar
              Benn receive the speech himself in the city of Jerusalem, which
              was then called "Ilya," and Omar brought to Palestine and wrote to
              Christians a covenant of security over their churches and crosses,
              requiring that none of the Jews dwell in that holy city. Since
              then, Arab tribes have flowed from Syria, Al Hijaz, found Yemen
              and inhabited Palestinian lands, most of which have become Muslim,
              and Arabic has become the dominant language.
            </p>
            <h5>amaouyan's Covenant 661 - 750</h5>
            <p>
              In the amaouyan covenant, Palestine belonged to Damascus, governed
              by Sulaiman Bin Abdulmalik. One of the greatest traces of that
              period was the rock dome built by Abdulmalik Bin Marwan in the
              place from which the Prophet came forth to heaven on the night of
              captivity and lameness, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was
              completed by the Walid Bin Abdulmalik, which is still in existence
              today, and the city of Ramlah, where Solomon bin Abdulmalik built
              his famous palace and the White Mosque.
            </p>
            <h5>The Abassian Covenant 750 1258</h5>
            <p>
              After the end of the rule of the amaouyan State, Palestine came to
              belong to the Abasian State, visited by Al-Khalifa Al-Mamoudi and
              his son Al-Mahdi. In the shadow of the Abasiyah State, the process
              of Arabization has increased and new generations have emerged as a
              result of the matrimony between Arab pioneers and the people of
              the country.
            </p>

            <h5>Crusader occupation 1095 1291</h5>
            <p>
              The foreign occupation of Palestine has returned with the end of
              the 11th century. Europe has experienced many political, social
              and economic problems between raw material poverty, population
              growth, and differences between kings and knights and between
              Popes and kings. The raid on the east was a comfortable solution
              for all sides. The moral shipments began with a speech by Pope
              Urban II in 1095, in which the public demanded that the Holy Tomb
              of Christ be removed from the hands of Muslims and that Jerusalem
              be cleansed of them. Peter Al-Nak led the first two-century
              military campaign known as the Crusades because it took the Cross
              as its emblem. Peter occupied the sand, destroyed Jaffa and
              surrounded Jerusalem with an estimated 40,000 soldiers. After a
              month of siege, the small Egyptian garrison there surrendered,
              entering Jerusalem in 1099 and killing as soon as they entered
              large numbers of its Arab inhabitants, capable of many historical
              references of 70,000. The Crusaders declared the establishment of
              a Latin kingdom in Jerusalem and extended their influence to
              Ashkelon, Bissan, Nablus and Aca and settled in Tiberias.
            </p>
            <h5>The Battle of Hattin.</h5>
            <p>
              After a violent fight with the crusaders, Noureddine Zenke
              succeeded in recovering some cities and the Emirates. Salahuddin
              completed the victories, which were the famous Battle of Hattin,
              after which the Holy House was restored in 1187.
            </p>

            <h5>The battle of Ein Goliath.</h5>
            <p>
              During the reign of the monarchy, Saif al-Din Qatz and Dahir
              Bipers repelled the Mongol invasion that invaded large parts of
              the Muslim world in the battle of Ain Jalut near Nasiriyah in 1259
              and was one of the most important and famous Islamic battles.
            </p>

            <h5>Ottoman covenant</h5>
            <p>
              The Ottomans triumphed over the Mullahs in the battle of Marj Dagg
              near Aleppo in 1516 and entered Palestine, which has since been
              under Ottoman rule for four centuries.
            </p>

            <h5>Napoleon Campaign 1799</h5>
            <p>
              France, led by Napoleon, tried to invade Palestine after the
              occupation of Egypt, but the campaign returned defeated after
              arriving in Acca, where it failed to enter the city thanks to its
              fortifications and the prowess of its leader, Ahmed Pasha.
            </p>

            <h5>For the British occupation of 1917.</h5>
            <p>
              After the victory of British troops against Turkey in World War I
              under General Allenby's command, Palestine entered in 1917 under
              British Mandate until 1948, and withdrew to allow Jews to
              establish their own State in Palestine, which was called Israel.
              With the help of both Britain and the United States, Zionist gangs
              succeeded in defeating Arabs in the 1948 war and declared the
              State of Israel an absence from the Palestinian arena for more
              than 2,000 years.

            <h5>Jericho, small Palestine.</h5>
            <p>
              Jericho is an ancient Palestinian city that has grown back to more
              than 10,000 years, known for its fertility and water wealth, the
              Palestinian vegetable and fruit basket. Listed by UNESCO on 17
              September 2023. During the period of British and Jordanian rule,
              the southern part of Jericho belonged to the Jerusalem district,
              the northern part to the Nablus district, and in 1997 it was
              occupied by Israel and built in and around 16 settlements, setting
              up 10 military camps and bases. In the 1990s, it was handed over
              to the Palestinian National Authority after the Oslo Agreement and
              became the centre of Jericho Province in the West Bank, giving it
              its historical, geographical and tourist location the title of
              small Palestine or the miniature entity of history. In varying
              periods of time, they have suffered multiple Israeli military
              incursions and have been and continue to be affected by permanent
              and temporary military barriers, depending on the situation on the
              ground. It has been an important crossing point since ancient
              times, and the eastern gate of Palestine has been formed.

              Beer Seven The oldest and largest historic city of Palestine.
            </h5>
            <p>
              The seven oldest and largest historic cities of Palestine, the
              first Palestinian city occupied by British forces in 1917, was
              ruled by the Ottomans for centuries and was a difficult number in
              the wars in the region, especially the Arab-Israeli wars, given
              their strategic location. According to the 2005 census, the city
              of Beer had a population of 185,000, the vast majority of whom
              were Jews, after most of its Arab population had been displaced
              after the 1948 war. Some of the followers and academics now
              estimate the population of Beersheba at around 200,000, some of
              whom have been subjected to Israeli citizenship and the majority
              of their land and property have been looted.The indigenous
              inhabitants of Beersheba are Bedouin tribes and have been
              displaced to refugee camps in Jericho and then to Jordan, some of
              which are in Gaza.

              Jenin (the centre), the Jenin camp and a group of villages. The
              city was known for its resistance to the Israeli occupation,
              particularly its camp, which became a symbol of resilience and
              resistance. He is subjected to ongoing military operations in an
              attempt to eliminate resistance.

              Letters and the Prophets held on to a long history of its roots
              across the ages and centuries. At a time when we, the Arabs and
              Muslims, need a correct reading of the history of Jerusalem in
              order to deal with this issue, we are witnessing a powerful attack
              by the Zionist movement to spread the wrong reading of the history
              of Jerusalem to the entire world. This attack culminated in the
              Israeli Government's commemoration of the 3,000-year-old King
              David Al-Quds. The Zionist objective is to complete the
              Judaization of the city after its occupation and rape, to spread
              Israel's claim that it is an eternal capital of Israel, which has
              sovereignty over the city, and to limit the question of Jerusalem
              to a dispute between Muslims and Christians over its holy places
              and how it is managed.

              Brief historical timeline of Jerusalem:
              <li>
                Jerusalem has a long history. It has been destroyed at least
                twice, besieged 23 times, attacked 52 times, and captured and
                recaptured 44 times.
              </li>
              <li>
                It was captured by the Muslims in 637 CE during the reign of
                Caliph Umar (رضي الله عنه). This occurred within five years of
                the death of the Prophet (ﷺ).
              </li>
              <li>
                The city was taken by the Christian Crusaders in 1099 and the
                Muslim and Jewish inhabitants were massacred. In 1187, the city
                was recaptured by Salahuddin Ayyubi. He not only let the
                surviving Crusaders free to leave the city, but also gave many
                of them provisions for their journey home.
              </li>

              <li>
                In 1244, Jerusalem was sacked by the Tatars, who annihilated the
                Christian population. They were driven out by the Ayyubids
                (descendents of Salahuddin Ayyubi) in 1247. Between 1260 and
                1517, the city was ruled by the Mamluks. They were former slaves
                brought up as Muslim soldiers and played a pivotal role in
                checking the Mongol advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                From 1517 right up to 1917, the city came under the control of
                the Ottomans. They brought great prosperity to the city,
                particularly Sulayman the Magnificent, under whose rule were
                built the walls around the Old City.
              </li>
              <li>
                Jerusalem came under the control of the British between 1917 to
                1948. Following civil war, the city was divided into two. The
                eastern half (including the Old City) became part of Jordan,
                while the western half became part of the newly established
                state of Israel.
              </li>
              <li>
                Following the 1967 ‘Six Day’, the whole of Jerusalem came under
                the control of the Israelis. They claim sovereignty of the site
                of Masjid al-Aqsa but custodianship is held by the Islamic waqf
                trust. However, Israeli forces are permitted to patrol and
                conduct searches within al-Aqsa.

            <h4>Here is Gazza</h4>
            <h5>Articles about Gaza</h5>
            <p>
              Gaza, a daughter of a long history, witnessed the vagaries of
              time, called Napoleon: "The gate of Asia, the entrance of Africa";
              she kept her name and home, despite all the accidents she had
              experienced, and was punished by kings, invaders and greedy men.
              In the southern region of the Palestinian coast of the
              Mediterranean Sea, on an area of no more than 360 km2, the city of
              Gaza. It was built on a hill about 45 m above sea level and on the
              edge of fertile land, which comes immediately after the wilderness
              of Sinai, to be the natural station for all those from Egypt, to
              the Sham, and from Sham to Egypt. The name "Gaza" was replaced by
              the kingdoms and powers that had been taken over. The Canadians
              called it "Hazate," the Hebrews "Azza," and the Horseman "Hazato,"
              and the ancient Egyptians called it "Gadato."

              />

              In the Greek Lexicon Ioni, in the Turks, in Gaza, and in the
              English, in Gaza. The Arabs called it "Gaza" or "Gaza Hashem." The
              name "Gaza" was associated with the Arabs in the name of Hashem
              Bin Abdul Manaf, who died there, returning from his trade to Mecca
              in 524am. Gaza was the place of his caravan and the shrine of his
              shrine. The people of Gaza did not lose sight of that honour and
              the association between them and Quresh and Makkah, where their
              city housed the mausoleum of the Second Grandfather of the
              Messenger Muhammad (Pray for Allah) and named their largest mosque
              in his name. One of the imams of Islam and its great
              philanthropists, Imam Muhammad bin Idriss al-Shafei, was also born
              in this city. In his book, Yaqout al-Hamawi, Gaza stated: "A city
              gas at the far north side of Egypt, Gaza was a woman who built the
              port of the city of the Sahel near the sea, and the mole bordered
              from the Euphrates to the feathers adjacent to the Egyptian home."

              So the son of Butta goes on his journey, and he says, "Then we
              walked until we arrived in Gaza City, Egypt's first country, with
              plenty of countries, lots of architecture, good markets, many
              mosques, and fences on them." Historian Aref Al-Aref (E: 1973), in
              his book, lists several possibilities for the meaning of the name
              of Gaza, which may be powerful, invulnerable, and may be wealth.
              While the first opinion is desirable, Palestinian historian
              Mustafa Murad al-Dabagh, in a footnote to his encyclopaedia on the
              Gazan home, is likely to mean between the store and the treasure
              and what can be saved. This view was taken by the Lebanese
              historian Anis Fareha in his book, entitled "The Names of Lebanese
              Cities and Villages and Interpretation of their Meanings."

            <h5>Gaza Solid rock in front of the Israeli occupier.</h5>
            <p>
              Gaza lived under the darkest and most bloody days and suffering of
              the Israeli occupation. In his account of the endless
              confrontations between the inhabitants of Gaza and the forcibly
              displaced Palestinians and the Israeli occupation forces, the
              writer Harun Rashid says: "Gaza, from the very first moments of
              Palestinian displacement, has been a focus of national agitation.

              <img
                src="assets/images/Gaza-1918SoonAfterBritishOccupation.webp"
                alt="Gaza-1918SoonAfterBritishOccupation"
              />

              These displaced persons, who came to her, carried in their eyes
              and hearts pictures of their cities, villages, farms and schools,
              continued to motivate them to infiltrate her and return to her
              fourth place." The Palestinian guerrilla movement and the sudden
              attacks on the people of Gaza, particularly in the 1950s, expanded
              into a remarkable guerrilla activity. During 1955 1956, the people
              of Gaza carried out more than 300 guerrilla attacks on several
              Israeli positions and settlements. After Israel and the resistance
              s occupation of Gaza following the 5 June 1967 war, Gaza became
              aware of a new pattern of ransom work. In the three years
              following the occupation, the guerrillas were in control of Gaza
              at night, and the Israelis were taking it back in the day, a fact
              investigated by the British Sunday Times in one of its 1969
              issues, an investigation entitled "Gaza at night for the
              guerrillas." According to a study entitled "Armed Resistance in
              the Gaza Strip (1967 . 1974) " of Al-Athamneh, he considered that
              armed resistance in the Gaza Strip had grown steadily. During that
              period, a total of some 971 clashes with the occupation occurred
              in Palestine, with the share of Gaza alone of 730 clashes. From
              the Jabaliya al-Ghazawi camp, an uprising of stones began in 1987,
              during which time Hamas was founded to start a new turn on the
              question of Palestine, particularly in the history of Gaza, which
              was printed by the movement in its intellectual language and made
              it, over time, the starting point of its struggle against the
              Israeli occupier. In 2000, the Al-Aqsa intifada played a role in
              the development of confrontational tactics between the Israeli
              resistance and the occupying Power in Gaza, which led to Israel
              and the resistances withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. Subsequently,
              Israel launched four wars against Gaza after withdrawing from it;
              in December 2008, it was called "stained bullets," in November
              2012, and in July 2014, it was a war of "sustained shovel" over
              Gaza. Israeli artillery and rocket attacks in 2019 killed dozens
              of civilians. At dawn on Saturday 7 October 2023, Operation
              Al-Aqsa, carried out by the Gazan resistance against the
              occupiers, involved a massive resistance attack on Gazan cover
              settlements, with more than 5,000 rockets and missiles, followed
              by a massive attack on settlements by land, sea and air. Israel
              and the resistances human losses amounted to more than 2,000
              settlers and soldiers, more than 2,500 wounded, some 240 Israeli
              prisoners in Gaza, and billions of dollars of material losses as a
              result of the beating of settlement infrastructure, the escape of
              settlers and the paralysis of the Israeli economy. But Israel's
              response to what Operation Iron Swords called, with huge military,
              financial, political, American and European cover, is to be the
              innocent civilians in Gaza who are the victims of this war.
              Israeli retaliation killed more than 8,000 Palestinians, injured
              more than 20,000 civilians, according to Palestinian medical
              sources, and destroyed a large number of mosques, churches and
              hospitals, relief centres, schools, neighbourhoods and displaced
              persons and the resistance groups. Israel declared its objective
              to eliminate Palestinian resistance in Gaza and to relocate the
              Palestinian people of Gaza to the Sinai desert in Egypt. Gaza; the
              city that former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wished to
              wake up one day, the sea was swallowed, but Gaza and the sea were
              fed by the gum of history, power and immunity before Israel was
              present in centuries, and was attended by Benjamin Netanyahu in
              his book "A Place Under the Sun" about a dialogue between him and
              an old Palestinian man from Jabalia Ghazawi camp: Where are you
              from? Palestinian: from Majdal (Achlon settlement). Netanyahu: Are
              you going back to Magdal? Palestinian: God willing, peace will be
              achieved, and we will return to Majdal. Netanyahu: If God wills,
              peace will come, you visit Majdal, we visit Jabalia, the
              Palestinian individual: we return to Majdal, and you return to
              Poland. Dialogue's over.

              To date, Palestinian martyrs have accounted for some 19,000, with
              51,000 injured, mostly women and children, as a result of the

              These massacres is still going and no one will try to stop them
