            <p>My name is Palestine and i an the  land of prophets, martyrs, resistance and steadfastness, 
                and the ongoing conflict between right and wrong is at the heart of the Middle East, 
                with which the conflict of Israeli occupation has lasted for more than 70 years.
                I am an issue on which all generations have been raised. In this blog, 
                we will look at my history and religious standing  as a cradle of

                <h5>The Immigration of the Canalans</h5>
                <p> The first important human migration to Palestine began at the beginning of the third millennium B.C., namely, that of the Canadians, who were known as the places where they came down. After a period of time, there were three languages: the Canada, the Aramaic, the language of Christ, and the Arabic, and Palestine continued to be called the land of Kanaan until 1200 B.When the Cretaceous tribes invaded her.</p>
                <h5>Ibrahim's immigration is at peace.</h5>
                <p>In the third millennium B.C., Abraham emigrated peace from the town of Orr in Iraq to Palestine, and there was Isaac's father, Jacob, also called Israel, and to him the Israelis belonged to him.</p>
                <h5>Israelis</h5>
                <p>Because of the famine in Palestine, Jacob and his children emigrated to Egypt, where his son, Joseph, was based on its safes, a story that the Holy Quran, in Surah Joseph, separated. The Israelis settled in Egypt and there were many in number, but they began to be persecuted under Ramses II. Moses decided to bring them out to the land of Kanaan, a story that was mentioned in the Holy Koran in many places.
                    The children of Israel stayed in the desert for 40 years before they were able to enter Palestine after the death of Moses. After the death of Moses, there was peace in the reign of the prophet Joshua. David was able to establish a kingdom for the children of Israel in Jerusalem after the Israelis had triumphed over Goliath.
                </p>
                <h5>Palestine under Greek occupation</h5>
                <p>Alexander's greatest victory over the Horse is one of the most important events of the fourth century B.C., where he captured Syria, Gaza and Jerusalem and annexed it to the Greek Empire in 332 B.After his death, his empire was divided among his leaders, and Palestine was under the control of Commander Antejos, who was defeated by the Championship in Gaza in 321 B.Since then, I have been under the rule of Antijos III in Syria in 198 B.C
                    Since then, Palestine has been living in a state of unrest in many States, such as the Maccabees and the Arabs of Al-Anbat, in 90 B.M, and she remained a member of their "pure" capital until she was occupied by the Romans.</p>
                <h5>Palestine under Roman occupation</h5>

                <p>During the period of Roman rule, Palestine witnessed the birth of Jesus son of Mary, but in 37 the Jews roasted him to the Roman Governor and accused him of infidelity and death from the story of steel, with all its details in the Islamic and Surveying Colonies.</p>
                <h5>Jewish rebellion.</h5>
                <p>The Jews have tried to exploit the religious freedom that has been granted to them in Jerusalem since their return from the Babylonian families in the quest for a State of their own, but the Romanian Governor, with the help of the Arab population of the country, launched an attack on them in 71, occupied Jerusalem and killed a large number of Jews before fleeing to Syria, Egypt and other Arab countries.

                    The last attempt to establish a Jewish State in Palestine was in 135, when a Jewish rabbi claimed to be insubordination, when Roman Governor Hadrian attacked them and occupied and destroyed the Jewish area of Jerusalem, and a new city was built in that place that was denied to Jews. After that incident, the Jews did not attempt to stir up any unrest in Palestine until the twentieth century, in the middle of which they witnessed the establishment of the State of Israel, more than 2,000 years after the demise of their State in 586 B.Mm-hmm. At the hands of Nassar.</p>

                <h5>The Islamic Fatah of Palestine </h5>
                <p>Al-Khalifa Abu Bakr al-Sadid sent several armies in 633 to open the country of Al-Sham, under the leadership of Amr bin al-Ass, and to expand the son of Abu Safian, Shafbil bin Hassana, and Abby Obaida bin al-Surrah. He defeated the rum in the valley of the vehicle south of the Dead Sea and tracked them to Gaza in 634.
                    Amr bin Al-Ass made great victories over the Roma in the battle of Ajnadin in 634 and opened a stall, Besan Wald and Jaffa, and when Theodoros, the brother of Roman Emperor Hercules, took over the command of the Roman army, ordered Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, his leader, Khaled bin al-Walid, to go from Iraq to Palestine.
                    Al-Khalifa Abubakr al-Sadid died and the caliph was taken over by Omar bin al-Tabhar, who ordered the Muslim armies present in Palestine to continue fighting to complete Fatah. Khaled bin al-Walid ordered the unification of the Islamic armies into one army. Khaled clashed with the Roma in the battle of Yarmouk, where the Muslim victory was a decisive moment in the history of Palestine, when the Romans were expelled from it.
                    
                    He required that Caliph Omar Benn receive the speech himself in the city of Jerusalem, which was then called "Ilya," and Omar brought to Palestine and wrote to Christians a covenant of security over their churches and crosses, requiring that none of the Jews dwell in that holy city. Since then, Arab tribes have flowed from Syria, Al Hijaz, found Yemen and inhabited Palestinian lands, most of which have become Muslim, and Arabic has become the dominant language.
                    </p>
                    <h5>amaouyan's Covenant 661 - 750</h5>
                    <p>In the amaouyan covenant, Palestine belonged to Damascus, governed by Sulaiman Bin Abdulmalik. One of the greatest traces of that period was the rock dome built by Abdulmalik Bin Marwan in the place from which the Prophet came forth to heaven on the night of captivity and lameness, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was completed by the Walid Bin Abdulmalik, which is still in existence today, and the city of Ramlah, where Solomon bin Abdulmalik built his famous palace and the White Mosque.</p>
                    <h5>The Abassian Covenant 750 1258</h5>
                    <p>After the end of the rule of the amaouyan State, Palestine came to belong to the Abasian State, visited by Al-Khalifa Al-Mamoudi and his son Al-Mahdi. In the shadow of the Abasiyah State, the process of Arabization has increased and new generations have emerged as a result of the matrimony between Arab pioneers and the people of the country.</p>

                    <h5>Crusader occupation 1095 1291</h5>
                    <p>The foreign occupation of Palestine has returned with the end of the 11th century. Europe has experienced many political, social and economic problems between raw material poverty, population growth, and differences between kings and knights and between Popes and kings. The raid on the east was a comfortable solution for all sides. The moral shipments began with a speech by Pope Urban II in 1095, in which the public demanded that the Holy Tomb of Christ be removed from the hands of Muslims and that Jerusalem be cleansed of them.

                        Peter Al-Nak led the first two-century military campaign known as the Crusades because it took the Cross as its emblem. Peter occupied the sand, destroyed Jaffa and surrounded Jerusalem with an estimated 40,000 soldiers. After a month of siege, the small Egyptian garrison there surrendered, entering Jerusalem in 1099 and killing as soon as they entered large numbers of its Arab inhabitants, capable of many historical references of 70,000.
                        
                        The Crusaders declared the establishment of a Latin kingdom in Jerusalem and extended their influence to Ashkelon, Bissan, Nablus and Aca and settled in Tiberias.</p>
                    <h5>The Battle of Hattin. </h5>
                    <p>After a violent fight with the crusaders, Noureddine Zenke succeeded in recovering some cities and the Emirates. Salahuddin completed the victories, which were the famous Battle of Hattin, after which the Holy House was restored in 1187.</p>

                    <h5>The battle of Ein Goliath.</h5>
                    <p>During the reign of the monarchy, Saif al-Din Qatz and Dahir Bipers repelled the Mongol invasion that invaded large parts of the Muslim world in the battle of Ain Jalut near Nasiriyah in 1259 and was one of the most important and famous Islamic battles.</p>

                    <h5>Ottoman covenant</h5>
                    <p>The Ottomans triumphed over the Mullahs in the battle of Marj Dagg near Aleppo in 1516 and entered Palestine, which has since been under Ottoman rule for four centuries.</p>

                    <h5>Napoleon Campaign 1799</h5>
                    <p>France, led by Napoleon, tried to invade Palestine after the occupation of Egypt, but the campaign returned defeated after arriving in Acca, where it failed to enter the city thanks to its fortifications and the prowess of its leader, Ahmed Pasha.</p>
                    
                    <h5>For the British occupation of 1917.</h5>
                    <p>After the victory of British troops against Turkey in World War I under General Allenby's command, Palestine entered in 1917 under British Mandate until 1948, and withdrew to allow Jews to establish their own State in Palestine, which was called Israel. With the help of both Britain and the United States, Zionist gangs succeeded in defeating Arabs in the 1948 war and declared the State of Israel an absence from the Palestinian arena for more than 2,000 years.</p>

                <h5>Jericho, small Palestine.</h5>
                <p> Jericho is an ancient Palestinian city that has grown back to more than 10,000 years, known for its fertility and water wealth, the Palestinian vegetable and fruit basket. Listed by UNESCO on 17 September 2023.

                    During the period of British and Jordanian rule, the southern part of Jericho belonged to the Jerusalem district, the northern part to the Nablus district, and in 1997 it was occupied by Israel and built in and around 16 settlements, setting up 10 military camps and bases.
                    
                    In the 1990s, it was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority after the Oslo Agreement and became the centre of Jericho Province in the West Bank, giving it its historical, geographical and tourist location the title of small Palestine or the miniature entity of history.
                    
                    In varying periods of time, they have suffered multiple Israeli military incursions and have been and continue to be affected by permanent and temporary military barriers, depending on the situation on the ground.
                    
                    It has been an important crossing point since ancient times, and the eastern gate of Palestine has been formed. Today it includes the Karamah crossing, which facilitates the movement of passengers and trade to and from Palestine, but can only be entered and exited through two gates, under the control of the occupying army.</p>

                    Amr bin Al-Ass made great victories over the Roma in the battle of Ajnadin in 634 and opened a stall, Besan Wald and Jaffa, and when Theodoros, the brother of Roman Emperor Hercules, took over the command of the Roman army, ordered Abu Bakr al-Sadiq, his leader, Khaled bin al-Walid, to go from Iraq to Palestine.
                    Al-Khalifa Abubakr al-Sadid died and the caliph was taken over by Omar bin al-Tabhar, who ordered the Muslim armies present in Palestine to continue fighting to complete Fatah. Khaled bin al-Walid ordered the unification of the Islamic armies into one army. Khaled clashed with the Roma in the battle of Yarmouk, where the Muslim victory was a decisive moment in the history of Palestine, when the Romans were expelled from it.
                    
                    He required that Caliph Omar Benn receive the speech himself in the city of Jerusalem, which was then called "Ilya," and Omar brought to Palestine and wrote to Christians a covenant of security over their churches and crosses, requiring that none of the Jews dwell in that holy city. Since then, Arab tribes have flowed from Syria, Al Hijaz, found Yemen and inhabited Palestinian lands, most of which have become Muslim, and Arabic has become the dominant language.

                    <h5>amaouyan's Covenant 661 - 750</h5>
                    <p>In the amaouyan covenant, Palestine belonged to Damascus, governed by Sulaiman Bin Abdulmalik. One of the greatest traces of that period was the rock dome built by Abdulmalik Bin Marwan in the place from which the Prophet came forth to heaven on the night of captivity and lameness, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was completed by the Walid Bin Abdulmalik, which is still in existence today, and the city of Ramlah, where Solomon bin Abdulmalik built his famous palace and the White Mosque.</p>

                    <p>The foreign occupation of Palestine has returned with the end of the 11th century. Europe has experienced many political, social and economic problems between raw material poverty, population growth, and differences between kings and knights and between Popes and kings. The raid on the east was a comfortable solution for all sides. The moral shipments began with a speech by Pope Urban II in 1095, in which the public demanded that the Holy Tomb of Christ be removed from the hands of Muslims and that Jerusalem be cleansed of them.

                        Peter Al-Nak led the first two-century military campaign known as the Crusades because it took the Cross as its emblem. Peter occupied the sand, destroyed Jaffa and surrounded Jerusalem with an estimated 40,000 soldiers. After a month of siege, the small Egyptian garrison there surrendered, entering Jerusalem in 1099 and killing as soon as they entered large numbers of its Arab inhabitants, capable of many historical references of 70,000.
                        
                        The Crusaders declared the establishment of a Latin kingdom in Jerusalem and extended their influence to Ashkelon, Bissan, Nablus and Aca and settled in Tiberias.</p>
                    <h5>The Battle of Hattin. </h5>
                    <p>After a violent fight with the crusaders, Noureddine Zenke succeeded in recovering some cities and the Emirates. Salahuddin completed the victories, which were the famous Battle of Hattin, after which the Holy House was restored in 1187.</p>

                    <h5>The battle of Ein Goliath.</h5>
                    <p>During the reign of the monarchy, Saif al-Din Qatz and Dahir Bipers repelled the Mongol invasion that invaded large parts of the Muslim world in the battle of Ain Jalut near Nasiriyah in 1259 and was one of the most important and famous Islamic battles.</p>

                    <h5>Ottoman covenant</h5>
                    <p>The Ottomans triumphed over the Mullahs in the battle of Marj Dagg near Aleppo in 1516 and entered Palestine, which has since been under Ottoman rule for four centuries.</p>

                    <h5>Napoleon Campaign 1799</h5>
                    <p>France, led by Napoleon, tried to invade Palestine after the occupation of Egypt, but the campaign returned defeated after arriving in Acca, where it failed to enter the city thanks to its fortifications and the prowess of its leader, Ahmed Pasha.</p>
                    
                    <h5>For the British occupation of 1917.</h5>
                    <p>After the victory of British troops against Turkey in World War I under General Allenby's command, Palestine entered in 1917 under British Mandate until 1948, and withdrew to allow Jews to establish their own State in Palestine, which was called Israel. With the help of both Britain and the United States, Zionist gangs succeeded in defeating Arabs in the 1948 war and declared the State of Israel an absence from the Palestinian arena for more than 2,000 years.</p>
